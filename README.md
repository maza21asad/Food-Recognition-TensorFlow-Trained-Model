# Food-Recognition-TensorFlow-Trained-Model
This repository contains the TensorFlow trained model for a food recognition application. The model is designed to identify various food items using deep learning techniques, trained in Python with Jupyter Notebook and optimized using TensorFlow Lite for mobile deployment.

## Model Overview:

- **Language & Tools**: Python, Jupyter Notebook
- **Framework**: TensorFlow
- **Techniques**: Transfer Learning for enhanced training
- **Optimization**: TensorFlow Lite for mobile optimization

## Features:

- Ability to recognize different food items through image processing.
- Utilizes transfer learning to improve accuracy and reduce the need for extensive datasets.
- Optimized with TensorFlow Lite to run efficiently on mobile devices.

## How to Use the Model:

### Training the Model:
1. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the notebook file and open it in Jupyter Notebook to view the training process.
4. Run the cells in the notebook to train the model. Adjust parameters and dataset paths as needed.

### Exporting to TensorFlow Lite:
1. Once the model training is complete, use the TensorFlow Lite Converter script provided in the repository to convert the model.
2. The script will output a `.tflite` file, which can be integrated into mobile applications.

### Integration into an Application:
1. Incorporate the `.tflite` file into your Android or iOS project.
2. Utilize the TensorFlow Lite Interpreter to run predictions on mobile devices.
